			<p class="center" id="width">Hello, thank you for visiting. Every week at Epicodus we work on pair programming Monday-Thursday where we 
			we work in pairs to learn and apply concepts in programming. This is our first introductory week where we learned 
			basic git commands, HTML, CSS, and recently Bootstrap! We are given code as well as writing our own. With pair 
			programming one person controls the mouse and proofreads, while the other types. This is beneficial because 
			learning is very interactive and both have input in what occurs during class and coding. On Friday is an 
			independent project where we work individually and apply skills we learned as pairs in class.</p>

					<h3>About me</h3>
				</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Hi, I'm Kenneth! I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I am currently 21 years old 
				and I was born on <span class="important">.February 9th, 1997. </span>I am from a half-Chinese,  half-Vietnamese heritage. I also
				speak Cantonese. <span class="important">My hobbies include basketball, video games, and traveling.I love
				trying new food	so my preference for style in no particular order is Indian, Cantonese, and Mexican food.</span>
				In term	of basketball I love the NBA, so coming from Kansas City we had no team; therefore, I affiliate the Boston
				Celtics as my favorite team because:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>They gave my favorite player, Kevin Garnett, a championship</strong></li>
					<li>They are the biggest contenders in the East</li>
					<li>I love the team, players, coaches, and all</li>
				</ol>
				The video games I enjoy playing are whatever the big thing 	is at the time. I always enjoy competition so I like
				to transition to the next challenge whenever that arise. I have two lovely pet Chihuahuas. Traveling is one of my most recent passions. As a child
				I enjoyed to travel by myself but 	within his last year I had the opportunity to go overseas for the first time and it is my new found love.
				I aspire and quite frequently travel when the opportunity arises. </p>

					<h3>Background</h3>
				</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Out of high school and going into college I was aspired to be an engineer, but going into my third 
				year of college I lost my drive to pursue that route for my own personal reasons and traveled instead.
				Now, <strong>I am here attending Epicodus to explore my options in developing and see where this can lead.</strong> I 
				really like Seattle, so now I am here. I consider myself to be tech-savvy, so I will see where this 
				routes takes me. </p>
